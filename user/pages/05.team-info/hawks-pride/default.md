The identity of the Rib Lake/Prentice football team can be summed up in two words, Hawks Pride. To explain what Hawks Pride means, the team developed 3 core standards we strive to follow each and every day:

- No Excuses, No Explanations

- 4-6, Snap to Whistle

- ONE

Each player is asked to know and understand these standards, and live by them each day.

“Hawks Pride” is about not only what players do on the field, but how they represent the team off the field as well.
