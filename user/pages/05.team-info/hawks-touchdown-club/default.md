The Hawks Touchdown Club is an organization formed by parents and fans of the RLP Football team to support and cheer on the Hawks. They provide homemade meals for the team every Thursday night before game day. These meals have become something the team and coaches look forward to each Thursday. The Hawks are LUCKY to have such great support from their families and fans.
