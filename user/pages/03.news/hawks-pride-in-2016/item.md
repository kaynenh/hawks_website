Be a part of something special in 2016 by joining, following or supporting the Rib Lake/Prentice Hawks Football team. “Hawks Pride” goes deeper than a saying on a T-shirt. It is not only a way to practice and play football, but a way to live your life! Looking forward to a great 2016!

The list of benefits goes on and on. Here’s a few more:

Brand new middle school authentic jerseys donated by the JJ Watt Foundation

Improving physically, mentally and becoming a better teammate. Things that will help you regardless of your favorite sport or activity!
