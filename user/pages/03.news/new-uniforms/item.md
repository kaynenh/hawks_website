The Hawks middle school football team will have brand new uniforms next year courtesy of the JJ Watt Foundation. The foundation donated over $6400 for the uniforms the middle school players will wear next year. Watt’s Foundation donates to middle schools in the states of Wisconsin and Texas. The foundation has donated over $900,000 to middle schools in the last few years. Their mission is to “provide after-school opportunities for middle-school aged children in the community to become involved in athletics, so that they may learn the character traits of accountability, teamwork, leadership, work ethic, and perseverance, while in a safe and supervised environment with their peers.”

The uniforms will be an upgrade from the current jerseys which have been handed down through the years. Stay tuned for pictures of the new design coming soon. Check the Star News for an upcoming story about the donation.

The Hawks football program is very grateful for the donation and is excited to start out the season looking good in fresh uniforms!
